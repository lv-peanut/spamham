    "The model first uses the CountVectorize class to extract each post's word counts into a matrix.\n",

    "* The model was trained on the TRAIN data. \n",
    "* Evaluated on the TEST data trying to optimise precision and recall. I tested a number of variations to optimise these metrics. It was possible to get the accuracy of spam classification fairly high (recall 99% or higher) especially by using ngrams that effectively act as context. But this came at the cost of reducing recall of ham to <50%. In the end I went for a more balanced approach as I was unsure whether it was worse to have false negatives or false positives for spam.\n",
